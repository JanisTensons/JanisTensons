## Projects

- [Giphy API](https://github.com/JanisTensons/giphy-app)
  - Working on the Giphy API project gave me valuable experience in integrating APIs, designing with users in mind, and enhancing engagement through visual content

- [Rick and Morty API](https://github.com/JanisTensons/rick-and-morty)
  - This project allowed me to gain valuable experience in API integration, data retrieval, and delivering an engaging user experience

- [JSONPlaceholder API](https://github.com/JanisTensons/posts)
  - The main goal of the project was to utilize the versatility of the JSONPlaceholder API to build a strong and adaptable platform for developers to simulate and test their applications as if they were using a real RESTful API
