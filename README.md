## Projects

- [iBank](https://github.com/JanisTensons/i-bank/tree/main/i-bank)

I've learned the art of full-stack development, diving into the world of fintech and mastering secure transactions, financial data management, and currency exchange

- [Rick and Morty API](https://github.com/JanisTensons/rick-and-morty)
  - This project allowed me to gain valuable experience in API integration, data retrieval, and delivering an engaging user experience

- [JSONPlaceholder API](https://github.com/JanisTensons/posts)
  - The main goal of the project was to utilize the versatility of the JSONPlaceholder API to build a strong and adaptable platform for developers to simulate and test their applications as if they were using a real RESTful API
